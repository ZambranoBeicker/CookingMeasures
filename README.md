# CookingMeasures
This is a mobile App built with React Native that tries to help you to measure the time you spend in every step of your cooking process. The app is in a early stage where the main UI is being built and later will be implemented a backend to save data about the time you spend. The developers only have an android device to test so the app is ony meant to be working well for android devices.
